# Human-Activity-Recognition
The population of ageing people is continuously increasing around the world. Currently, assisting aged people during their day-to-day activities, increasing their safety, security and self-support, are considered key study contests. Activity recognition[1][2][3] based on new wearable technologies (wearable sensors and accessories, smartphones, etc.) is one of these important challenges. Identifying human activities are fundamental functions to provide healthcare and assistance services to ageing people living alone, physically or mentally disabled people, and children. These individuals need continuous scrutinizing of their activities to notice abnormal circumstances or avert erratic events such as falls.
